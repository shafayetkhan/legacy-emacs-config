# Environment Variables

#   Path to the [[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh][Oh My Zsh]] configuration.

ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh

# Use my own [[file:zsh-theme.org][Happiness Zsh theme]] (stored in the =~/.oh-my-zsh/themes=
#   directory.

#ZSH_THEME="happiness"

# Disable autosetting terminal title.

DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"

# Displays red dots while waiting for completion.

COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"

# Disable bi-weekly auto-update checks of Oh My Zsh.
#   This has caused problems for me. I will update by hand.

DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"

# History

#    We will let the =HISTFILE= variable as it is.

SAVEHIST=1000
HISTSIZE=1000

# Options

#   See [[http://linux.die.net/man/1/zshoptions][this page]] for all options.
#   Why would you type 'cd dir' if you could just type 'dir'?

setopt AUTOCD

# Of course, it is much more useful with settings for =$CD PATH=.
#   However, it takes the full path of the directory and that isn't
#   that helpful, so we'll leave cdpath pretty much alone:

cdpath=( . ~ )

# The following makes cd = pushd

setopt AUTOPUSHD

# When you type in things, being case insensitive sounds like a good
#   idea:

setopt NO_CASE_GLOB
setopt NO_CASE_MATCH
setopt EXTENDEDGLOB

# I don't like every tab on my terminal sharing the same history.

setopt NO_SHARE_HISTORY
setopt APPEND_HISTORY

# Call the Profile

#   Machine specific information (like environment variable
#   information) should be stored in the =~/.profile=. I thought that
#   Zshell automatically sourced that, but it appears not.

if [[ -f $HOME/.profile ]]
then
    source $HOME/.profile
